1. var, let, const
https://www.freecodecamp.org/chinese/news/javascript-var-let-and-const/
   1.1 var
       1.1.1 var can be declared globally or within a function / locally.
             - When var is declared outside the outermost function, the scope is global.
             Any variables with var outside the outermost function can be used in windows.
             - When var is declared in the function, the scope is local. It can only be
             accessed within a function.

       1.1.2 Hoisting - Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope
       and initialized with the undefined value.
             // Code (works):
             console.log(greeter);
             var greeter = 'say hello';
             // Can be explained as:
             var greeter;
             console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
             greeter = 'say hello';

   1.2 let (block scope)
       1.2.1 block is defined by {}.
       1.2.2 Hoisting - Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their scope
       and uninitialized. Without using declaration can receive 'Reference Error'.

   1.3 const (constant value, block scope)
       1.3.1 Cannot be modified and redeclared => Initialization when declaration
       1.3.2 Cannot update const object, but the properties of the object, e.g. person.name.
       1.3.3 Hoisting - Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their scope
       and uninitialized.

   1.4 Comparison
       1.4.1 var is global or functional scope, while let and const are block scope.
       1.4.2 Variable with var can be modified/updated and redeclared within its scope.
       Variable with let can be updated but not be redeclared. Variable with const can neither
       be updated nor be redeclared.
       1.4.3 Variables declared with all three indicators are hoisted to the top of their
       scope. Variable var is initialized by variable undefined, not for variable let and const.
       1.4.4 Although var and let can be declared without initialization, const must be
       initialized during declaration.

   1.5 From Tutorial script
       1.5.1 Variables and constants declared with let or const respectively are not hoisted but
       instead scoped in their respective block.
       var is hoisted, let isnâ€˜t.

2. Roundup Quiz
   2.1 Result of [1, 2, 3, 4].map((a) => a * a).reduce((a, b) => a + b)
       [1, 2, 3, 4].map((a) => a * a) // [1, 4, 9, 16]
       [2, 4, 9, 16].reduce((a, b) => a + b) // 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30
