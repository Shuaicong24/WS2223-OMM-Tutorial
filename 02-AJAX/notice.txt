2. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML)
Allows passing around data between client-and server-side applications back and forth â€“ without refreshing the page
==> Partial Refresh without loading the full page again

3. XHR (XMLHttpRequest) AJAX request
Ready States: 0,1,2,3,4(done)

4. fetch (a "new" API, which simplifies AJAX by using Promises)

5. async & await
await keyword can only be used in the async functions.

6. Postman (A tool to test APIs)

7. Same Origin Policy (SOP)
A frequent AJAX problem because of violating the Content Security Policy.
URL: http://example.com
Different origin:
    1. https://example.com - Different protocol
    2. http://www.example.com - Different host
    3. http://example.com:3830/ - Different port
    4. http://example.org - Different domain

SOP tries to hamper cross site scripting and would block AJAX request to foreign domain entirely.
Solutions:
    1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
    2. JSON with Padding (JSONP)
    3. Apache Reverse Proxies
